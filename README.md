# Contributing
Content + UX is an all-volunteer effort. That means we *love* contributors! Contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://contentandux.org/code-of-conduct.html), so please do read it.

## Report a bug
To submit a bug report, open a [bug report issue](https://github.com/theecrit/contentandux/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D).

## Submit a feature or content request
To make a suggestion or request an improvement, open a [feature request issue](https://github.com/theecrit/contentandux/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BIdea%5D).

## Contribute to the code
We use a shared repo workflow ([read GitHub's description](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)).

### Working on an issue marked `ready to work on`
Issues labeled `ready to work on` should have all the info you need to begin working.

1. Assign the issue to yourself.
2. Clone the files to your local drive.
3. Create a branch using the format {username}/{change-description} (e.g. *theecrit/update-menu*)
4. Make your changes at the local level.
5. Commit your changes to the branch.
6. Open a pull request containing a concise description of the changes you made and why you took the specific approach you did.
7. Request a review.
  
The C+UX group manager (me, repo owner Jess) will review and merge your changes if accepted, or add comments/request changes as appropriate.
  
### Working on an issue marked `input wanted`
Issues labeled `input wanted` are still being defined. All you need to contribute to these is an opinion.

1. View the issue.
2. Add a comment with your opinion.
3. Give yourself a fist bump.

Once consensus is reached and the Issue description has been sufficiently defined, the Issue can be relabeled to `ready to work on`.
