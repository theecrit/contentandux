								<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
								<p>The Content + UX group is dedicated to providing a productive and harassment-free experience for everyone. By joining our Slack workspace, you agree to adhere to this Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates it may be sanctioned or expelled from the Content + UX group at the discretion of the Admin team.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Harassment</h3>
								<p>We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to every member of the Content + UX group.</p>

								<p>Harassment includes:

    							<ul><li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>
    								<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
    								<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.</li>
    								<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.</li>
    								<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
    								<li>Threats of violence.</li>
    								<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
    								<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
    								<li>Stalking or following.</li>
    								<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>
    								<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
    								<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
    								<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.</li>
    								<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
    								<li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>
    								<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li></ul></p>

    							<p>Content + UX prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The Admin team will not act on complaints regarding:

    							<ul><li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia.’</li>
    								<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>
    								<li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial.</li>
    								<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.</li></ul></p>

    							<h3 class="major">Intellectual property and the sharing of content in and outside the group</h3>
    							<p>The strength of the Content + UX community lies in our members’ generosity and willingness to contribute their thoughts, experiences, and insights, to help each other learn and grow. In turn, members are expected to respect each others’ intellectual property and intellectual contributions. As such, we will not tolerate users who engage in plagiarism, infringement of copyright and/or intellectual property, sharing others’ words and ideas without attribution, or mining the group for financial gain or profit. To be even more clear about it, the following behavior is strictly prohibited:

    								<ul><li>Passing off someone’s ideas or words as your own (even if you’ve changed some of the language)</li>
										<li>Sharing someone else’s ideas or words without attribution</li>
										<li>Failing to use quotation marks to indicate you’re reproducing someone else’s words</li>
										<li>Deliberately misrepresenting or lying about the source of your contributions</li>
										<li>Sharing content posted to the group, including screenshots, messages or other written or visual content (anonymised or not) outside of the group, without express written permission from the creator (this does not include public tweets or blog posts</li>written elsewhere and shared to the group).</li></ul>

								These bullets are adapted from <a href="https://www.plagiarism.org/article/what-is-plagiarism">plagiarism.com</a> (see how easy that was?).</p>


    							<h3 class="major">Posting guidelines</h3>
    							<p>Every member of Content + UX is expected to familiarize themselves with and follow the <a href="/posting-guidelines.html">Posting Guidelines</a> beyond the bullets shared here:

    								<ul><li><a href="/posting-guidelines.html#promo">No self-promotion and absolutely no soliciting</a>.</li>
										<li><a href="/posting-guidelines.html#links">No drive-by link bombs</a>.</li>
										<li><a href="/posting-guidelines.html#name">Do not use a company name as your display name</a>.</li>
										<li><a href="/posting-guidelines.html#ontopic">Keep your posts on-topic for the channel</a>.</li>
										<li><a href="/posting-guidelines.html#crosspost">Avoid cross-posting to multiple channels</a>.</li>
										<li><a href="/posting-guidelines.html#jobs">All job openings, internships and contract/freelance gigs must go through our submission form and must include salary/pay details</a>.</li></ul>

								Violations of the posting guidelines may result in Admin action, so make sure you <a href="/posting-guidelines.html">read them in full</a>.</p>


    							<h3 class="major">Reporting violations of the CoC</h3>
    							<p>If you’re being harassed by a member of Content + UX, notice that someone else is being harassed, or would like to report any other violation of the Code of Conduct, you can report your experience through any of the following channels:

    								<ul><li>Send a direct message in the Slack workspace to any member of the Admin team. Please note that our admins are in different time zones, and  will respond as promptly as is feasible. See the <a href="#admin">Admin Team</a> section for current contact info.</li>
										<li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:coc@contentandux.org">coc@contentandux.org</a> (note that this email goes to all admins; if you need to report a member of the Admin team, we encourage you to send a DM to another admin in Slack instead).</li></ul>

    							This code of conduct applies to the Content + UX community, but if you’re being harassed by a member of the group outside the Slack group itself, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of Code of Conduct violations by Content + UX members (especially members of the Admin team), seriously. This includes Code of Conduct violations outside our spaces, regardless of when they took place. Because this is a professional community, the Admin team reserves the right to exclude people from Content + UX based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Content + UX and behavior towards people who are not in Content + UX.</p>

    							<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

    							<p>The Admin team  will do its best to respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. In some instances, however, making a conduct determination requires sharing the nature of the violation with the accused, which may be enough to identify the reporter. Likewise, in some instances we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so is necessary for the safety of Content + UX members or the general public. We will not name victims without their explicit consent.</p>

    							<a name="admin"></a><h4 class="major">Admin Team</h4>

    							<P>The Admin team consists of:

    							<ul><li>Jess Sand, group manager (@Jess_Sand)</li>
    							<li>Sara Border  (@Sara Border)</li>
    							<li>Clay Delk (@claydelk)</li>
    							<li>Jess Hooper (@jessh)</li>
       							<li>Ben Luby (@Ben)</li>
 							<li>Kenneth Yau (@logorrhoea)</li></ul></p>

    							<p>You can reach us via direct message in the Slack group, or send an email to <a href="mailto:coc@contentandux.org">coc@contentandux.org</a> (note that this email goes to all admins).</p>


    							<h3 class="major">Consequences</h3>

    							<p>Participants asked to stop any behavior violating this Code of Conduct are expected to comply immediately. In most minor first-time incidents, posts in violation of this Code of Conduct will be deleted by a member of the Admin team and we’ll issue a warning directly to the member in violation. On the third incident, the Admin Team may deactivate the member’s account. That said, the Admin team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from Content + UX. In some cases, the participant may also be identified as a harasser to other Content + UX members or the general public. We reserve the right to sanction or ban anyone from the community for any reason, whether explicitly stated in this Code of Conduct or otherwise.</p>


    							<h3 class="major">Attribution</h3>
    							<P>This code of conduct was last updated on May 13. 2020 and is based on the example policy from the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment">example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by the Geek Feminism community.</p>
